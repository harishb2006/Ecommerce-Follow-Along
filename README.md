## Ecommerce Follow Along Project

Welcome to the **"Ecommerce Follow Along Project"**. This is a hands-on project where we will build a complete e-commerce application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). The goal is to learn how to develop a full-stack web application step by step.

## Milestone 1: Project Overview

### 1. Understanding the MERN Stack:

-**MongoDB:** A database for storing application data in a flexible, document-based format.
-**Express.js:** A backend web application framework for building APIs and handling server logic.
-**React.js:** A frontend JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
-**Node.js:** A runtime environment that allows JavaScript to run on the server.

### 2. REST API Structure

REST APIs are used to allow communication between the frontend and backend.

We'll create APIs for:

  -**User Authentication:** Allowing users to register and log in.
  -**Product Management:** Adding, updating, and retrieving product data.
  -**Order Handling:** Managing customer orders.

### 3. Database Schema Design

We'll learn how to design and organize data using MongoDB. A schema helps us define how the data is stored and related.

### 4. Authentication

Authentication ensures only the right people can access certain features. For example:

    -Users need to log in to place orders or see their personal data.
    -It keeps the app secure by verifying users' identities.
